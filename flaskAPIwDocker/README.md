# Flask

Start with:
* install docker-compose
* run docker-compose up

This Flask application uses two features:

- It uses the Flask application factory pattern
- It uses gunicorn as a proper app server (this is safe to use in production)

The `gunicorn.py` file contains a few config settings. `accesslog = '-'` ensures
that things get logged to STDOUT.
